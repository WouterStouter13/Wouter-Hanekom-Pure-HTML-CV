# Wouter-Hanekom-Pure-HTML-CV

This is my first published website, which serves as a CV written in pure HTML code. 

I really enjoyed this project, and I am very excited to publish many more sites in the coming weeks as I grow my skills. 

I am hoping to have land my first permanent job as a Web Developer by the end of Octover. My aim is to impress prospective employers with my portfolio, as I do not have any experience in this industry.
